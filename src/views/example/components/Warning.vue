    Creating and editing pages cannot be cached by keep-alive because keep-alive
    include does not currently support caching based on routes, so it is
    currently cached based on component name. If you want to achieve a similar
    caching effect, you can use a browser caching scheme such as localStorage.
    Or do not use keep-alive include to cache all pages directly. See details
